# Codeforces++
### Codeforces extension pack

# Installing
Go to the latest [release](https://github.com/LeoRiether/CodeforcesPP/releases/) and download `script.user.js`

# Development
Run `yarn build` to build with Parcel

# Contributing
Think there's something missing from Codeforces++ or some feature could be better? I think so too, please send some PRs

# Tests
`yarn test`
I probably won't write many tests, if any at all

# TODO
+ [ ] Docs
+ [ ] @icon
